Going through the Learn Web 3 Dao whitelist course. 


They recommended just copy and pasting the React code to finish this course. Instead, I chose to take a few weeks and learn the basics of React so I can understand how things are rendering. I'm glad I did as I needed to learn React anyway.

I ran into a lot of bugs from rewriting their code. I almost gave up and just copy pasted theirs. But I figured out the their were some abi typos in terms of calling the functions. Also, I imported the abi incorrectly into the 'constants' folder. 

I'm glad I persisted because it gave me a better understanding of the errors that I was receiving. The abi function calls were pretty easy to figure out. The JSON parsing issue is what confused me. Then I figured out that the constants were attempting to read the JSON abi which I had copy pasted incorrectly. 

All in all it was a ton of fun and now I know the basics of React!
